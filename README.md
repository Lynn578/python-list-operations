# Python List Operations Example

This Python script demonstrates basic list operations including appending, inserting, extending, popping, sorting, and finding the index of an element in a list.

## Code Explanation

- Create an empty list called `my_list`.
- Append elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list using `append()`.
- Insert 15 at the second position (index 1) using `insert()`.
- Extend the list with elements 50, 60, and 70 using `extend()`.
- Remove the last element from the list using `pop()`.
- Sort the list in ascending order with `sort()`.
- Find the index of the element 30 using `index()`.

## Sample Output

After append: [10, 20, 30, 40]  
After insert: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]  
After extend: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]  
After pop: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]  
After sort: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]  
Index of 30: 3  
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

## How to run

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the script to a file, for example, `list_operations.py`.
3. Run the script from the command line:

python list_operations.py
